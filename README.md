# FloodGate Rebrand

## Setup

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Spin it up locally

`gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`

## Phase 1 Objectives

1. Home page first
1. Giving
1. Watch Online
1. Service times
1. I'm new sign up form

## Priorities

1. **Performance** - It needs to be fast.  Our Lighthouse score is 1/100 right now.  Should ideally be 90+.
2. **Navigation** - We need all top-level links always accessible.  Currently critical links are hidden from view.
3. **Engagement** - People come to either learn about us (new visitors), or find out about upcoming events (new/existing members), or want to watch something (existing members).
4. **Feedback** - Ensure visitors have the ability to reach out to us about any topic.
